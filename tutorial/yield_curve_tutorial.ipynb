    "# Tutorial Task: Create a Forward Bank Bill Class #\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use the Bank Bill and Bond classes to create a Forward Bank Bill class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create some bank bill and bond instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a yield curve using these instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a new Forward Bank Bill class which inherits from the Bank Bill class and uses the yield curve to give an arbitrage-free yield.\n",

    "### What is a Class\n",
    "In programming, a class is a way to organize and group data and functions together into a single unit by describing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What information the thing should have (its properties)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What actions the thing should be able to do (its behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "The information inside a class is called attributes , and the actions are called methods (which are just functions inside the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you define a class, you can create multiple objects from it.\n",
    "Each object will have its own copy of the attributes and will be able to use the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of making an object from a class is called instantiation, and the object is called an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is when a new class automatically gets the attributes and methods from an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class you start from is called the parent class (or superclass).\n",
    "The new class you make is called the child class (or subclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "The child class inherits everything from the parent class and can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use everything the parent already has\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add new things of its own\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change (override) things if needed\n",
